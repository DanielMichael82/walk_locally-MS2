## Design

#### Colour Scheme

<img src="assets/images/color01.png" width="80" height="80"> <br> **#5F735D** is the main color of the site, I feel that this color is a great repesentation of the walking theme.

<img src="assets/images/color02.png" width="80" height="80"> <br> **#96B593** is the secondary color of the site, this color is a shade that compliments **#5F735D** and helps the burger menu and other buttons standout.

#### Typography

The Lato is the main font used throughout the site with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Open-Sans is also used throughout the site to support Lato.

#### Imagery

Imagery is important. The large, hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention, I have added animations to emphasise this.
